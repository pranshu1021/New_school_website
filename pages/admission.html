        <h2>Admission </h2>
        <h5>Admission Procedure</h5>
        <p>School Visit: Admission process starts with the parents and child visiting the school and liking the school after a detailed discussion with the admissions counselor, a guided tour of the school and an informal meeting with teachers and the leadership team. Parent needs to give some basic information in the enquiry form at this stage so that the counselor can assist him / her better. It is advisable to visit the school during school hours (8.30 am to 3.30 pm monday to friday) to get a better sense of how well the school functions, how the learning happens and how happy the children look and how committed the teachers are. One could also chat with the parents of children studying in the school informally to get a parents perspective, we encourage you to do so and we would love to make the introductions. In fact these are some of the things every parent should do at any school before deciding to admit their child.

Application Form: Once a child and parent decide to join the school an application needs to be filled up giving all the particulars of previous education, medical history, etc.</p>
